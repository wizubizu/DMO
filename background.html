						<p>As this is the first of many episodes, permit me to start this discuss by giving a short background and express my gratitude to Governor Rauf Aregbesola for the opportunity to truly SERVE the people of Osun.</p>
						<p>A year after graduating from Harvard with a Master's degree, I returned to Nigeria with a singular purpose - to contribute to the development of my country. It's interesting to note that out of the 15 Nigerians that were admitted to my school at Harvard that year, I am the only one back in Nigeria. However, I have always enjoyed the support of my colleagues and friends who stayed back in the United States. They have been a strong pillar of support to me. </p>
						<p>Fast forward, in 2013, two remarkable things happened. I joined the World Bank as a Consultant in January 2013 and in December of that same year, I had a strong conviction to contest for a seat in the House of Representatives and that was how my political journey started. I decided not just to complain, criticise those in government or engage in wishful thinking but rather to get into the ring and fight for the betterment of Nigeria. The story of why House of Reps will be told in another episode. Suffice to say that the Federal Government collects 52% of the share of all funds accruing to the Federation while all the 36 States and 774 LGAs share the remaining 48%.</p>
						<p>I joined the APC as the political party to actualize the vision. I attended ward meetings, funded party activities, consulted with party leaders, conducted several outreach programs etc.</p>
						<p>But as God designed it, the outing in 2014/2015 did not lead to my winning the party nomination to contest in the general election. Of course, my approach throughout the campaign was purely "seeking an opportunity to SERVE my people" and so it was never a "do or die" matter for me. After all, I have a good job to return to. </p>
						<p>As a result, I became friends with co-contestants including the incumbent, Hon Adeyinka Ajayi (aka YACO) who over the years has become a worthy big brother to me.</p>
						<p>At the end of the campaign exercise, I returned fully to my work at the World Bank.<br>However, sometimes in 2015, in a bid to contribute to the development of my people back home in the State of Osun, I identified an area I could SERVE and I reached out directly to Governor Rauf Aregbesola without any intermediary.</p>
						<p>To cut the long story short, by God's own design, few months after my initial engagement with Mr Governor, he was at the World Bank to seek support for a basic education intervention and because of the project I manage happens to be in all States, I usually get to represent my Team Leader as part of the Bank delegation that receives visiting Governors at the Bank. <br>It was at that meeting in the World Bank that Mr Governor announced to my colleagues his intention to have me work with him in his quest to develop Osun.</p>
						<p>Fast forward, January 2017, the appointment was made official. While a lot of my family, friends and colleagues congratulated me on the appointment, as expected many were skeptical and even worried about many things associated with political appointment ranging from maintaining my Christian virtues, getting required backing to function effectively, effect on my professional career etc. </p>

						<ol>
							<li>When I was delaying (due to work commitments) reporting in Osogbo after the appointment had been made officially, Mr Governor personally called from Germany to request that I take up the appointment.</li>
							<li>Also, at my request, Mr Governor personally visited the World Bank and met with the Country Director to inform him of my appointment and request for the Bank's support.</li>
							<li>An official letter was also written to the Bank's Country Director on my appointment. </li>
						</ol>
						<p>I am therefore very grateful to Governor Rauf Aregbesola for the confidence he has in me and for the opportunity to serve at the highest level of the State government. </p>
						<p>Without any doubt, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola stands so tall amongst his governor colleagues for several things ranging from genuine commitment to the development of the State (and this is definitely not patronizing but from personal experience working closely with him); to giving Women and Youths unique opportunities to serve at the highest level of government. The unwavering support of Mr Governor that I receive has been very vital to the success of my office. </p>
						<p>Though, as I will be sharing in latter episodes, the sacrifices involved in public service has been colossal but surely it has been a great privilege to serve my people. For this, I am extremely grateful to Mr Governor. </p>
						<p>I have equally enjoyed significant support from everyone working with Mr Governor including Madam Deputy Governor, Mrs Grace Titi Laoye-Tomori; the current Chief of Staff and by God's grace, the next Governor of Osun, Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola ; the now-former SSG, Alh Moshood Adeoti; Special Adviser-Governor's Office, Barr Adebisi Adejare etc.</p>
						<p>In subsequent episodes, I will be building on this background to share vital <strong>LESSONS FROM THE FIELD</strong>. </p>
						<p>Thank you everyone and stay tuned for the announcement of the next phase of my <strong>PUBLIC SERVICE</strong>. </p>
